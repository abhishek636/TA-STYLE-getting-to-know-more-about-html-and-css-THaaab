       <h3>The Sunset</h3>
       
        <p>The sunset A sunset... The first impression of it is a beautiful and mystifying creation of the nature that leaves a great image in people?s minds; however, sometimes those images can associate with an opposite feeling like tiredness and anger.</p>
    
        
        
        <h3>Sunset seen</h3>

        <p>Slowly the sun was disappearing beneath the waves as last rays were visible and leaving its only hints in reddish sky. The sea was getting more active and violent. It looked like that the storm would occur, and I thought what would I do if it would really happen. I was scared and did not want to spend the night on the beach freezing and being frightened by the sea storm. I started to cry like a child that got lost. Then suddenly I felt that somebody put his or her hand on my shoulder. My body winced and I was scared to turn around. But I did and I saw my friend standing behind me. She started to cry and explain to me why she was so late. I didn?t feel any anger at her any more because for an unknown reason it was all gone when I saw her. We watched the end of the sunset, jumped into the car and left. While we were driving I looked back to that beach, the sea and the last rays of the sun as if I was saying good bye to a friend with whom I spent a long time and won?t see again.</p>
    

        <h3>Experience</h3>

        <p>Most people would say that they have seen the sunset, but my sunset was special to me because I didn?t choose to watch it, and I was angry at it because at first it was burning me and then it was killing my hope of getting warm. Yet, the main difference of this sunset for me was that I was not observing it as an amazing and incredible creation of the nature, but as a source of warmth and hope.</p>
