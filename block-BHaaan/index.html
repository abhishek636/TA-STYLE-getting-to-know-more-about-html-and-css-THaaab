                <p class="para">This article is about the species that is commonly kept as a pet. For the cat family, see Felidae.
                    For other uses, see Cat (disambiguation) and Cats (disambiguation).</p>

                <p class="para">The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                    reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
                    sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring,
                    trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is
                    most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It
                    can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and
                    other small mammals</p>

                <p class="para">During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are
                    still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats
                    may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social
                    nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats
                    may also display affectionate behavior toward humans, but were not domesticated.</p>
